Collectrium Address Book
============
Modal Address Book Implementation with MySQL

Synopsis
=============
This address book was written in the Ember.js framework, and takes advantage of UI Bindings and the core Ember services. It leverages Python Django for server operations.

Due to the relative maturity (or lack thereof) of Ember.js, a number of JS utilities were developed to manage fetch, list, and other AJAX operations.

Likewise, numerous form widgets were generated for Autocomplete, and others, as well as an extension of JQuery UI Widgets.

Caveats
=============
Please note that this is only a collection of sample code, and requires both MARKUP and server instances to work properly. For a working example, please contact the author.
